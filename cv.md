func reverseSeq(n: Int) -> [Int] {
  var newArray = [Int]()
  var reversedArray = [Int]()
    
    for i in 1...n {
        newArray.append(i)
        reversedArray = newArray
    }
    
    reversedArray = newArray
    
    for j in 0...(newArray.count - 1)  {
        reversedArray[j] = newArray.last!
        newArray.removeLast()
        print(reversedArray)
